------------

There's $100 in the pot. You have $25 left and your opponent bets $50. You are not “priced out” of the pot so to speak.
If you want to call, you can put your $25 in the pot.
In this case, if no other players match the $50 bet, the opponent gets $25 back immediately - the amount you couldn't match.
The player who shows down the best hand picks up the full pot in the middle of the table.

When a player's stack is less than the amount of the small blind, they are automatically considered all-in in the next hand they play, regardless of position.
